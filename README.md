## Introduction
Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews is a machine learning project designed to analyze and classify movie reviews based on their sentiment. Leveraging the power of Python and popular data science libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy, this project aims to uncover the emotional tone within movie reviews, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. By applying advanced natural language processing techniques, our goal is to provide insights into audience sentiments and preferences for a wide range of films.

Explore the world of sentiment analysis and gain valuable insights from the opinions of moviegoers with this project.

## Overview

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. In this case, we focus on movie reviews and classify them as either positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiments expressed in the text.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

These dependencies can be easily installed using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Dataset 
The sentiment analysis model is trained on a movie reviews dataset. Unfortunately, due to licensing restrictions, we cannot include the dataset in this repository. However, you can easily obtain it from platforms like Kaggle or other publicly available sources.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd sentiment-analysis-movie-reviews
```
3. Prepare your dataset:
- Download the movie reviews dataset (if not already provided) and place it in the data/ directory.
  
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```
5. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to analyze your movie reviews sentiment.

## Results
After running the analysis, you can expect to see the following results:

- Visualizations of sentiment distribution in the dataset.
- Performance metrics of the sentiment analysis model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Predicted sentiment labels for your movie reviews.

You can further fine-tune the model or explore different machine learning algorithms to improve the sentiment analysis accuracy.
